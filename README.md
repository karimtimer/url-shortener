Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
`3.1.2`
* Rails version

* System dependencies

  - use a modern version of either unix/linux.
  - PostgreSQL is used as the database, so please have this set up (e.g you can install this via Homebrew)

* Database creation
```
rake db:prepare
```

* Deployment instructions

Simply push to main, and the workflow should deploy the app to `fly.io`.

## How this works

This coding exercise implements a URL shortening service. A user can shorten a URL to be the hostname + 7 extra characters (all 7 being hexidecimal). For example:

- original URL: `https://github.com/karimtimer/url-shortener`
- Could shorten into something like: `timers-url-shortener.fly.dev/44daa93`
